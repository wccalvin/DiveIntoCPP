# Filesystem Library

`filesystem` library provides a set of facilities for performing operations on file systems.
The library offers a convenient way to manipulate file system paths, query file attributes, and
perform file system operations.

`std::filesystem::path`: represents file and directory paths.
`std::filesystem::directory_entry`: represents entry in a directory, such as a file or directory.
`std::filesystem::directory_iterator`: iterates over contents of a directory.
`std::filesystem::recursive_directory_iterator`: recursively iterates through directories.
`std::filesystem::file_status`: represents status of a file, including its type and permissions.
